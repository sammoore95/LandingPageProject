This is my second project within The Odin Project course. This project will be focused on HTML and CSS. I will be creating an entire web page from a dsign provided by the creators of The Odin Project. The design comes in the form of two images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors being used. My goal is to get my project as close as I can to the design provided.
